    "description": "One of the most significant changes introduced in Android 6.0 is Android Backup - a standarized mechanism for backuping apps' data. However, backup is not a new concept on Android - we had third party solutions there for years. What can we learn from them? What should be your strategy for backuping data? Is your app ready to handle database migrations properly, and handle old, no-longer-supported SharedPreferences' keys?<br/><br/>Attend my talk to learn:<br/>- How Android Backup works in general<br/>- How old-fashioned backup tools broke my app in the past<br/>- How to prevent such defects in Android Backup",

It just so happens there's already an extremely popular, Open Source, Cross Cloud Platform called Kubernetes. You'll also need something to wire them together, maybe something that offers high performance RPCs, but also provides a toolset to generate services and clients in multiple languages. gRPC is a language and platform-neutral RPC framework, based on HTTP/2 and Protobuf, used to build highly performant and scalable APIs. <br/><br/>In this talk, we’ll demo the core concepts of gRPC and Kubernetes, and show you how to combine these two technologies to create scalable and performant microservices rooted in lessons learned from Google’s experience!",
